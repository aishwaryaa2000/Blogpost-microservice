I(external world) can talk to ingress.
Ingress helps to map specific endpoints of different deployment with outside world.
Map entire frontend on Ingress so that frontend is accessible to external world.
Ingress provides URL.
DNS server has ingress URL : Load balance i/p.
Frontend talks Internally with other services/deployment using Cluster IP
Need of ingress - gives URL
Frontend is mapped on Ingress
Frontend is now present in extenal world
Frontend calls specific endpoints of other services so even that has to be 
provided in Ingress, because external world does not know these endpoints.
eventbus is extremely internal so no mapping in Ingress
Across services, the endpoints should be unique to avoid ambiguity.

Skaffold is used for automatic image building and deployments.

Identify the endpoints and add in the ingress files.
Make changes in the code.
In blogcomment,blogpost,eventbus and query service
put the links according to the service name so that
deployments can talk to one another using the service ip/name.
In frontend,modify the links by incorporating the base URL i.e myproj.com.


Make changes in host inside C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc
Add ip and name
